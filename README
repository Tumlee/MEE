MEE (Math Expression Evaluator) is a simple program that takes and evalutes
mathematical expressions received from stdin, and then prints the result
to stdout.

It is currently not fully-featured enough to be truly useful
compared to an actual calculator program, although the classes and functions
that have been written for it (Particularly MExpr and MTokenTable) can
be used to be used for real applications.

A goal of this project is to teach MExpr how to simplify an expression that
has a mixture of variables and constant values.
